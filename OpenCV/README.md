# INFO1111 Assignment

## OpenCV
This is also mainly exploring the different algorithms that OpenCV offers.

Using this tool I will explore they use cases of computer vision, and how it can be used in medical applications.

## To get started
Install python 3 first and then install the modules
To install the opencv module.
```
pip install opencv-python3
```
or
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To execute the image_processing
```
python3 image_processing.py images/image_in_images_folder.
```

### To execute the computer vision optical flow algorithm

Dense algorithm
```
python3 computer_vision_optic.py video/video_in_video_folder dense
```

Sparse algorithm
```
python3 computer_vision_optic.py video/video_in_video_folder sparse
```
